Question Classification using POS tagging and NER
To use Standford NE Tagger download the required files from the Stanford NLP repository. The current implementation predicts the course labels HUM, DESC ... using a Linear SVM.
More feature engineering is needed to improve the current accuracy. The classification for fine classes will be implemented once the accuracy is improved.
